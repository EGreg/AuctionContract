# AuctionContract
Functionality for all kinds of auctions, where people compete to acquire various assets

## Overview
Each AuctionContract instance is produced by calling `AuctionFactory.produce(AuctionParams params)`, setting default parameters which include:

### AuctionParams
* `uint32 duration` in seconds, 0 means no auction end time, so it must be finished or canceled by owner
* `address currency` (ERC20 contract, or `0x0` means native coin)
* `uint256 startingBid` the first bid that starts the auction
* `uint256 minimumIncrease` the minimum difference between bids
* `uint256 retainFraction` the amount to refund when outbid, ranging between 0 and `FRACTION=100000` (default is 0)
